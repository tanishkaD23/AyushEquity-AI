#  AyushEquity AI
### AI-Powered Healthcare Inclusion & Fraud Detection System for Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY)

## 📌 Overview

AyushEquity AI is an AI-driven platform designed to improve healthcare accessibility and reduce fraudulent insurance claims under the Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY scheme.

The system helps government officials identify eligible families who have been excluded from the scheme while simultaneously detecting suspicious hospital claims using Machine Learning.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Millions of eligible citizens remain excluded from government healthcare schemes due to:

- Incomplete or incorrect documentation
- Lack of awareness
- Remote geographical locations
- Manual verification delays

At the same time, healthcare systems also suffer from:

- Fake patient registrations
- Duplicate insurance claims
- Unnecessary medical procedures
- Hospital fraud

AyushEquity AI addresses both challenges using Artificial Intelligence.
